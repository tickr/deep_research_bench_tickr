While Project Texas represents a $1.5 billion investment in security infrastructure https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/project-texas-tiktok-plan-stay-america-oracle-security/, implementation remains incomplete. Evidence suggests continued data flows to China despite claimed protections https://2pml.com/2025/02/12/project-texas/. The platform's collection of biometric data without comprehensive consent mechanisms creates substantial liability exposure.\n\n### Loss Potential\n\n**Frequency:** Medium-High\nRegulatory actions occurring annually across multiple jurisdictions. Pattern of enforcement escalating.\n\n**Severity:** Very High\nRecent €530 million fine represents single largest GDPR penalty for data transfers https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/irish-data-protection-commission-fines-tiktok-eu530-million-and-orders-corrective-measures-following. Potential for 4% of global revenue under GDPR.\n\n**Scenarios:**\n- Biometric data breach affecting US users: $500M-$1B exposure\n- EU-wide operational ban: €2-3B annual revenue loss\n- Class action for minors' data collection: $200-500M settlements\n\n**Comments:**\nCumulative GDPR fines now exceed €1.4 billion.

User complaint mechanisms exist but effectiveness unclear.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n**Rating: 3 (Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nEmerging AI regulations in EU and potential federal privacy legislation in US create evolving compliance landscape. Biometric data collection creates unique exposure - only three US states have protective laws https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-quietly-tweaks-privacy-policy-to-collect-your-bi-1847032399. Geopolitical tensions with China amplify regulatory scrutiny. Competitive platforms (Meta, Google) face similar issues but TikTok receives disproportionate attention due to Chinese ownership https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/project-texas-tiktok-plan-stay-america-oracle-security/.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n**Rating: 3 (Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nPattern of repeated violations suggests inadequate root cause analysis. €530M fine in 2025 for issues dating to 2021 indicates slow remediation https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/tiktok-slammed-with-530-million-gdpr.html.
