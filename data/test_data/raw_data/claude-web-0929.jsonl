The application processes user inputs (prompts) and generates responses using OpenAI's large language models. The mobile app collects and processes several types of data:\n\n1. Account information when users sign up or purchase premium plans https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/chatgpt-and-data-privacy-is-the-openai-tool-secure\n2. Conversation data including user prompts and AI-generated responses https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/\n3. Usage patterns and interaction data https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/\n\nThe mobile app offers different data retention options, including temporary chats that don't appear in user history but are kept up to 30 days for safety purposes. Additionally, when users join business accounts, administrators may have access to their OpenAI account, including content.\n\nOpenAI states that collected data is used to: provide, analyze, and maintain services; improve and develop services; communicate with users; prevent fraud and illegal activity; comply with legal obligations; and protect rights and safety. The company may also aggregate or de-identify personal data for analysis and improvement purposes.\n\nThe mobile app operates within a sandboxed architecture on iOS and Android, meaning it's generally isolated from other apps and the core system. The official ChatGPT app has strict permission protocols and does not automatically gain access to the phone's files, photos, or contacts.\n\n## Loss Analysis\n\nIn March 2023, OpenAI experienced a security breach triggered by an internal bug rather than an external attack. This breach exposed personal data—specifically chat histories and payment information of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during \"a specific nine-hour window.\" This security incident compromised the confidentiality of data subjects.\n\nThe Italian data protection authority (Garante) noted that OpenAI should have notified \"all European data protection authorities whose data subjects had been involved in the data breach. Given that the investigation documents showed that the event affected 440 Italian users, OpenAI should have notified the data breach directly to the Authority.\"\n\nIn December 2024, Italy fined OpenAI €15 million for GDPR violations, citing that the company did not notify authorities of the March 2023 security breach, processed personal information without an adequate legal basis, and violated transparency principles. The regulator also found that OpenAI had not provided mechanisms for age verification, potentially exposing children under 13 to inappropriate responses.\n\nThe Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) specifically stated that OpenAI used personal data to train ChatGPT \"without having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users\" and \"didn't provide an adequate age verification system\" to prevent users under 13 years old from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content.\n\n## Service Planning\n\n### Immediate (0-30 days)\n- Conduct comprehensive data mapping of all personal information collected through the mobile app\n- Review and update privacy notices specific to mobile app users\n- Implement enhanced age verification mechanisms\n- Develop breach notification protocols specific to mobile app incidents\n\n### 90 Days\n- Implement enhanced data retention controls that align with stated policies\n- Develop clearer opt-out mechanisms for data collection and training\n- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for mobile app operations\n- Enhance documentation of mobile app permissions and data access requirements\n\n### 6-12 Months\n- Develop region-specific compliance frameworks for mobile app deployment\n- Consider implementing Zero Data Retention options for mobile app users\n- Establish ongoing compliance monitoring and auditing processes\n- Develop comprehensive training for staff on mobile-specific privacy considerations\n\n## PCO Survey Sections\n\n### Description Of Products Exposures\n\n#### End Product And Intended Use\nThe ChatGPT mobile application is a consumer-facing AI chatbot that allows users to interact with OpenAI's large language models through text-based conversations on mobile devices. The app is intended for general information, creative assistance, and productivity enhancement.\n\n#### Key Customers\nThe mobile app serves both individual consumers and business users through various subscription tiers, including free users, ChatGPT Plus subscribers, and enterprise customers.\n\n#### Stream Of Commerce\nThe application is distributed globally through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, making it available in numerous jurisdictions with varying privacy and data protection regulations.\n\n#### Process Flow\n1. User downloads and installs the mobile application\n2. User creates an account or logs in with existing credentials\n3. User inputs prompts/questions through text or voice interface\n4. App transmits data to OpenAI servers for processing\n5. AI-generated responses are returned to the user's device\n6. Conversation data may be stored both locally and on OpenAI servers\n\n#### Sales Distribution\nThe application is available directly to consumers through mobile app stores. Premium features are available through in-app purchases and subscription models.\n\n#### Additional Details\nThe mobile app includes features that allow users to interact or share information with other users or third parties. For example, users can share ChatGPT conversations with others via shared links. Users can also send information to third-party applications, such as via custom actions for GPTs, or for searching the web to help answer questions.\n\n### PCO Operations Considered\n\n#### Conclusion Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nThe ChatGPT mobile application presents significant data privacy and liability concerns that require attention. While OpenAI has implemented some privacy controls, recent regulatory actions and identified gaps in compliance indicate areas needing improvement.\n\n#### Comments\nA federal court order currently mandates OpenAI to retain all ChatGPT conversations indefinitely, raising significant concerns about privacy, compliance, and data security, particularly in light of global regulations like GDPR. The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging copyright violations, which intensifies scrutiny of ChatGPT's data retention policies and AI's handling of intellectual property.\n\nUnder this court order, every ChatGPT conversation must be preserved indefinitely, including conversations users specifically marked for deletion. The retroactive nature of this order has particularly alarmed privacy advocates. The technical implementation of this order has proven challenging for OpenAI, requiring the company to maintain parallel data storage systems—one for active user data and another for legally preserved records that users cannot access or modify.\n\n### Loss Potential\n\n#### Frequency\nHigh - The mobile application processes millions of user interactions daily, each representing a potential data privacy incident.\n\n#### Severity\nHigh - Data breaches or regulatory violations could result in significant financial penalties, as evidenced by the €15 million fine from Italy's data protection authority.\n\n#### Scenarios\n1. Data Breach: Unauthorized access to user conversation data stored on OpenAI servers\n2. Regulatory Fines: Violations of GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy regulations\n3. Class Action Litigation: Users claiming improper data collection or use\n4. Intellectual Property Disputes: Third parties claiming copyright infringement from training data\n\n#### Comments\nLeaked OpenAI strategy documents reveal plans to develop ChatGPT into a highly personalized \"super assistant,\" sparking debates over data ownership, privacy risks, and security vulnerabilities. Businesses face heightened risks when using ChatGPT, including potential exposure of sensitive data and compliance challenges, especially in regulated industries like healthcare and finance.\n\nThe most significant vulnerability when using an AI chatbot is the user voluntarily sharing sensitive personal information. Details about finances, health, or private life, once entered into a chat, are sent to OpenAI's servers. If users are logged into an account and have not opted out of training, this data could potentially be reviewed by human AI trainers to improve the system. Although OpenAI says chats are anonymized, this process typically removes metadata, not the personal details users type into the conversation itself.\n\n### Design & Engineering\n\n#### Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nWhile the mobile app includes some privacy-enhancing features, significant design improvements are needed to address identified risks.\n\n#### Comments (labels, Warnings, IFUs, Legal Review)\nThe ChatGPT iOS app doesn't appear in Settings because it doesn't request any permissions by default. Only when users tap the Whisper (ChatGPT's text-to-speech feature) button does the phone prompt them to grant the app permissions. After granting permissions, the app appears in iOS Settings.\n\nThe mobile app typically only requests permissions for features like the microphone when users actively use voice input. In contrast, a desktop environment, particularly when using a browser, can have vulnerabilities related to browser extensions or malware on the computer itself that could potentially compromise the session. However, some privacy advocates argue that browser access is less invasive because it limits the device-level data an app can collect.\n\nThe official ChatGPT mobile app is designed to be minimally invasive in terms of permissions. If users deny permission, the core text-based functionality of the app remains fully operational. This \"just-in-time\" permission model gives users direct control over what the app can access.\n\n### Production & Manufacturing\n\n#### Rating (3 - Adequate)\nThe development and deployment processes for the mobile application demonstrate adequate controls, though improvements in data handling are recommended.\n\n#### Comments (suppliers, Risk Transfer, Contracts, Insurance)\nAll data transmitted between users' phones and OpenAI's servers is protected using TLS 1.2+ encryption, a standard protocol for securing communications over the internet. Once data reaches their servers, it is encrypted at rest using AES-256, one of the strongest and most widely used encryption standards. This dual-layered approach ensures that information is shielded from unauthorized interception both in transit and while being stored.\n\nOpenAI's security practices are validated by independent third-party audits. The company's API, ChatGPT Enterprise, and other business products have achieved SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, which is a rigorous assessment of its security, confidentiality, and privacy controls. These audits confirm that OpenAI's data handling aligns with high industry standards.\n\nOpenAI offers data retention controls for qualifying organizations to help them stay compliant. Qualifying organizations are able to configure how long OpenAI retains business data, including opting for a zero data retention policy in the API platform.\n\n### Regulatory Management\n\n#### Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nRecent regulatory actions indicate significant gaps in compliance with global privacy regulations.\n\n#### Comments (regulatory Standards, Inspections, Compliance History)\nAs with all technologies, ChatGPT comes with its set of challenges. Unauthorized access, data leakage, or unlawful use of data, including for training purposes, can all lead to serious regulatory and business risks. These risks can be addressed and mitigated through proper compliance measures.\n\nThe GDPR utilizes a principle-based approach and provides comprehensive safeguards to ensure the protection of individuals' privacy. These principles apply to the wide array of ChatGPT API applications where users may share their personal data. Adhering to GDPR provides a structured approach to prevent issues and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data.\n\nOpenAI states that it is committed to complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other relevant privacy laws. As part of this commitment, OpenAI allows users to delete, update, correct, and transfer their personal data stored in OpenAI records.\n\nIn a precedent-setting regulatory enforcement action, Italy's Data Protection Authority imposed a €15 million penalty on OpenAI for multiple violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This enforcement action represents a significant instance of a generative AI service provider facing monetary penalties under the European Union's comprehensive privacy framework.\n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall\n\n#### Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nWhile OpenAI has some monitoring systems in place, improvements are needed in breach detection, notification, and remediation processes.\n\n#### Comments (CAPA, Traceability, Recall Program, CRO Interactions)\nThe mobile app's data practices are not nearly transparent enough, and it's very likely that the platform is handling user personal data in ways that may not align with regulatory requirements. Users may find it hard to exercise their rights under GDPR - including their right to be informed and the right to be forgotten.\n\nBeyond app-level permissions, OpenAI provides significant user controls over data. The most critical is the ability to disable chat history and opt out of having conversations used for model training. When this feature is enabled, new conversations are not saved to history and are not used to improve the models, offering a more private experience.\n\nData Controls let users decide how ChatGPT uses their conversations and interactions. They specifically allow users to choose whether their conversations help improve models. Depending on whether users are signed in or not, options vary slightly: When signed out, users can choose if their chats are used to help train ChatGPT; when signed in, users have additional options like exporting data or deleting their account.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n\n#### Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nThe mobile application faces significant industry-specific exposures that require enhanced controls.\n\n#### Comments (emerging Hazards, Exposures)\nThe Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive (AILD) is a proposal by the European Commission to adapt non-contractual civil liability rules to artificial intelligence. The purpose of the AILD is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down uniform rules for certain aspects of non-contractual civil liability for damage caused with the involvement of AI systems.\n\nThe EU AI Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are both significant pieces of legislation in the European Union that regulate different aspects of technology. The GDPR is a fundamental (human) rights law that gives individuals a wide range of rights in relation to the processing of their data. On the other hand, the EU AI Act is a product safety law that provides parameters for the safe technical development and use of AI systems and is based on medical device safety legislation.\n\nAI poses significant challenges to data privacy and compliance, as it involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large amounts of personal and sensitive data. Data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US, impose strict obligations and restrictions on how organizations can use and share data, especially regarding AI applications.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n\n#### Rating (2 - Needs Improvement)\nImprovements are needed in incident response, investigation, and remediation processes.\n\n#### Comments (claims History, Corrective Actions, Loss Trends)\nIn March 2023, OpenAI experienced a security breach triggered by an internal bug rather than an external attack. This breach exposed personal data—specifically chat histories and payment information of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during \"a specific nine-hour window.\"\n\nOpenAI has faced regulatory scrutiny, and a major data breach further revealed weaknesses in ChatGPT's security system. This has brought more bad press for the company, and it has suffered further consequences from data regulators. The breach happened during a nine-hour window on March 20th, 2023 - between 10:00 and 19:00 Central European Time (CET). According to OpenAI, approximately 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers had their data exposed.\n\nBesides levying a €15 million fine, the Italian regulator ordered OpenAI to carry out a six-month-long communication campaign on radio, television, newspapers, and the internet to promote public understanding of how ChatGPT works. This specifically includes explaining the nature of data collected, both user and non-user information, for the purpose of training its models, and the rights that users can exercise.\n\n## Disclaimer\nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only.

Users can ask Alexa to set timers, control smart home devices, play music, and access information. Amazon is currently rolling out Alexa+, a more advanced version of the voice assistant powered by generative AI technology, which offers more personalized and intuitive interactions including individual voice recognition through Alexa Voice ID, nuanced calendar scheduling, Ring home security system integrations, and product purchasing capabilities.\n\nThe core functionality of Alexa relies on cloud processing, where audio of user commands is sent to Amazon's servers, encrypted, and processed. The company is expanding Alexa's capabilities with generative AI features that require the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud infrastructure.\n\nIn March 2025, Amazon implemented a significant privacy policy change by removing the option for local processing of voice commands on Echo devices. Starting March 28, 2025, all voice commands and instructions are now sent to Amazon's cloud for processing, eliminating users' ability to opt out of cloud processing.\n\n## Loss Analysis\n\nAmazon has a documented history of privacy violations related to Alexa, including a $25 million civil penalty paid in 2023 for indefinitely storing children's Alexa recordings in violation of child privacy laws. That same year, Amazon's Ring was fined $5.8 million after an investigation revealed employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers' private video footage.\n\nAmazon's privacy practices have faced significant scrutiny, with critics pointing to incidents where recordings of children's interactions with Alexa were stored indefinitely, leading to the $25 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2023. Additionally, Amazon employees have listened to thousands of audio samples to improve Alexa's performance, and there have been reports of Alexa recordings being used in criminal trials. The vulnerability of Amazon's cloud storage to hacking attempts also poses a risk to stored voice and video recordings.\n\nThe loss of privacy options while sending hours' worth of voice recordings to a tech company in the AI age has users worried about potential data breaches. As one commenter noted, \"Imagine the next time there is a data breach and someone has access to all your voice recordings, and the broad range of AI scammers the hackers could sell that data to.\"\n\n## Service Planning\n\n### Immediate (0-30 days)\n- Conduct comprehensive audit of current voice data collection, storage, and sharing practices\n- Implement enhanced user notification system regarding privacy policy changes\n- Develop interim privacy controls to mitigate risks from recent policy changes\n\n### 90 Days\n- Implement ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 31700 standards for voice data management\n- Develop and deploy enhanced data deletion verification systems\n- Conduct privacy impact assessments for all existing Alexa AI features\n\n### 6-12 Months\n- Redesign Alexa architecture to support privacy-by-design principles\n- Develop industry-leading voice data privacy standards\n- Implement comprehensive privacy training program for all staff with access to voice data\n\n## PCO Survey Sections\n\n### Description Of Products Exposures\n\n#### End Product And Intended Use\nAmazon's Alexa is a voice assistant technology integrated into Echo smart speakers and other devices designed to respond to voice commands for various functions in users' homes, such as setting timers, controlling smart home devices, and accessing information. The new Alexa+ service is an upgraded version powered by generative AI that includes individual voice recognition, nuanced calendar scheduling, Ring home security integration, and product purchasing capabilities. It's available free to Prime subscribers or for $19.99 per month for non-Prime users.\n\n#### Key Customers\nAmazon Prime subscribers represent a significant portion of Alexa users, as they receive Alexa+ as part of their subscription. Non-Prime users can access Alexa+ for $19.99 per month. The service is targeted at general consumers for home use, with particular appeal to smart home enthusiasts, busy professionals, and families seeking convenience through voice control.\n\n#### Stream Of Commerce\nAmazon makes Alexa services, products, applications, and skills available through various channels. Users can order products from third parties through Amazon stores, download applications from third-party providers, and enable third-party skills through Alexa services. Amazon also offers services or sells product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards.\n\n#### Process Flow\nWhen a user speaks to an Alexa-enabled device, the audio of what was said is sent to the cloud and encrypted for processing. Users can delete their voice recordings and associated text transcripts, as well as information Alexa receives from third-party smart home devices, using settings in the Alexa app or at Manage Your Content and Devices. When deletion is requested, Amazon begins the process of securely deleting the data from its cloud storage systems, though these deletion processes can take time to complete.\n\n#### Sales Distribution\nAmazon distributes Alexa-enabled devices and services through its own stores and platforms, allowing users to download applications from third-party application providers and enable third-party skills through Alexa services. Echo devices are sold directly through Amazon.com, Amazon retail stores, and select retail partners.\n\n#### Additional Details\nAs of March 28, 2025, all voice recordings from Echo devices must be transmitted to Amazon's cloud servers. Users who enable the \"Don't Save Recordings\" setting will lose access to the Voice ID feature, which allows Alexa to distinguish between different users. This policy change raises significant concerns about data privacy, security, and user control over their voice data.\n\n### PCO Operations Considered\n\n#### Conclusion Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAmazon's recent privacy policy changes removing local processing options for Alexa voice commands represent a significant regression in privacy protections. The requirement to send all voice commands to the cloud, even for users who previously opted out of cloud processing, creates substantial privacy and security risks. The decision to use digital assistants like Alexa presents a Faustian bargain for consumers. While these technologies offer great potential for improving quality of life, they also expose users to privacy risks by perpetually listening for voice data and transmitting it to third parties.\n\n#### Comments\nThe decision to send all voice recordings to the cloud raises significant privacy concerns. Given Amazon's track record on voice command privacy, including a $25 million civil penalty for indefinitely storing children's Alexa recordings and a $5.8 million fine for Ring after employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers' private video footage, users have legitimate reasons to be concerned about these policy changes.\n\n### Loss Potential\n\n#### Frequency\nHigh - The FTC has already taken enforcement action against Amazon for keeping kids' voice recordings (both audio files and transcripts) permanently and undermining parents' deletion rights. The FTC complaint also says that Amazon didn't use appropriate controls to limit which employees could access Alexa users' voice recordings, so thousands of employees had access to sensitive voice recordings that they didn't need. With increased regulatory scrutiny and the removal of privacy options, the frequency of incidents is likely to increase.\n\n#### Severity\nHigh - User data is an incredibly valuable commodity for tech companies like Amazon, and its storage has been at the center of numerous court cases. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million to settle federal charges that it had violated a children's online privacy law when it kept data for years that included voice recordings of minors and their locations. Future violations could result in more significant penalties, especially under GDPR which can impose fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue.\n\n#### Scenarios\n1. Data breach exposing voice recordings: A breach of Amazon's cloud infrastructure could expose millions of users' voice recordings, which could then be used by scammers for voice cloning and sophisticated fraud schemes.\n\n2. Regulatory enforcement action: Given Amazon's history of privacy violations, continued issues with voice data retention and employee access could trigger significant regulatory penalties, particularly under GDPR, CCPA, or from the FTC.\n\n3. Criminal proceedings using voice data: As has happened in the past, Alexa recordings could be subpoenaed for use in criminal trials, potentially exposing users to legal jeopardy from conversations they didn't realize were being recorded and stored.\n\n#### Comments\nVoice data stored in the cloud poses significant risks where hackers can gain access, or the voice technology companies themselves may misuse it. Once cybercriminals gain access to stored data on a device or cloud system, they can access recorded conversations and sensitive information. Smart voice assistants used in corporate environments pose additional risks, as many voice-enabled devices have microphones that are always on, leaving room for accidental recordings sent to the cloud.\n\n### Design & Engineering\n\n#### Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAmazon's recent design changes to Alexa, removing local processing options and requiring all voice commands to be sent to the cloud, represent a significant regression in privacy-focused design. This change prioritizes AI capabilities over privacy protections, creating unnecessary risks.\n\n#### Comments (labels, Warnings, IFUs, Legal Review)\nThe privacy rollback affects all Echo and Amazon smart device owners, even those not interested in Alexa+. Users who continue to enable the \"Don't save recordings\" setting will prevent Voice ID from working at all in their Echo devices, meaning that while generalized Alexa requests may still work, any personalized Voice ID tasks related to areas like music preferences, shopping, and reminders will cease functionality. Amazon promises that \"Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon's secure cloud… designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe\" and that encrypted voice requests are deleted immediately after processing.\n\nWhile some privacy controls remain in place, such as the option not to save recordings, this comes at the cost of losing Voice ID functionality. For voice AI systems, prior consent, clear identification, and an opt-out mechanism are essential to avoid legal risks. Voice AI must also be accessible, offering input alternatives and ensuring speech output is clear and understandable for users with hearing or speech impairments.\n\n### Production & Manufacturing\n\n#### Rating (3 - Managed)\nAmazon's hardware manufacturing processes for Echo devices appear to be well-managed, with appropriate quality controls and supplier oversight. However, the integration of software and hardware components presents some privacy and security challenges.\n\n#### Comments (suppliers, Risk Transfer, Contracts, Insurance)\nAmazon states that information about customers is an important part of their business, and they are not in the business of selling customers' personal information to others. They share customers' personal information only as described in their privacy policy and with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls. They make available services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services, such as ordering products from third parties, downloading applications from third-party providers, and enabling third-party skills through Alexa services.\n\nWhen a user interacts with a skill, Amazon may exchange related information with the developer, such as answers when playing a trivia skill, ZIP code for weather inquiries, or the content of requests, which may include text transcripts (but not voice recordings). By default, Amazon does not share personal information with skill developers. This represents a reasonable approach to risk transfer, though more transparency about third-party data access would be beneficial.\n\n### Regulatory Management\n\n#### Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAmazon has a problematic history of regulatory compliance regarding voice data privacy. The company faced backlash for quietly storing Alexa recordings by default until a U.S. Senator publicly questioned Jeff Bezos about the practice — five years after the first Echo was released. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million in civil penalties for indefinitely storing children's Alexa recordings, violating child privacy laws. That same year, Amazon's Ring was fined $5.8 million after an investigation revealed employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers' private video footage.\n\n#### Comments (regulatory Standards, Inspections, Compliance History)\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a European Union regulation effective since 2018 that addresses the need for individuals' control over their data and unifies rules for businesses serving EU residents. GDPR considers voice as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as voice recordings provide information on gender, ethnic origin or potential diseases. Thus, even if users do not share their names or credit card information in recordings, voice recordings are still PII.\n\nCCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) became effective in January 2020 and focuses on giving individuals control over their data - including what information is collected, how it is used or whether it is sold. CCPA considers audio recordings personal information and grants California residents request information about them.\n\nThe FTC has alleged that Amazon held onto children's voice and geolocation data indefinitely, illegally used it to improve its algorithm, and kept transcripts of their interactions with Alexa despite parents' requests to delete them. These practices would violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires online companies to alert and obtain consent from parents when they gather data for children under age 13 and allow parents to delete the data at will. In addition to the $25 million civil penalty, Amazon is now prohibited from using data that has been requested to be deleted, must remove children's inactive Alexa accounts, and is required to notify its customers about the FTC's actions against the company.\n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall\n\n#### Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAccording to a complaint filed by the Department of Justice on the FTC's behalf, Amazon responded to deletion requests by deleting files in some databases while maintaining them elsewhere – meaning the information was available for Amazon to use for its own purposes. The lawsuit alleges Amazon violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule by flouting parents' deletion requests, retaining kids' voice recordings indefinitely, and not giving parents the straight story about its data deletion practices. Amazon also allegedly violated the FTC Act by falsely representing that Alexa app users could delete their geolocation information and voice recordings and by engaging in unfair privacy practices related to deletion, retention, and employee access to data.\n\n#### Comments (CAPA, Traceability, Recall Program, CRO Interactions)\nAmazon allows users to delete their voice recordings and associated text transcripts, as well as information Alexa receives from third-party smart home devices, using settings in the Alexa app or at Manage Your Content and Devices. When deletion is requested, Amazon begins the process of securely deleting data from its cloud storage systems, though these deletion processes can take time to complete. Alexa does not support voice requests to delete data in all circumstances, and may not always interpret or execute deletion requests correctly. Users can review voice recordings and text transcripts associated with their account through the Alexa app or at amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings.\n\nHowever, data collected by third parties, like skill developers, and data stored outside of Amazon's cloud, like data stored on Echo or mobile devices, may not be deleted. Deletion requests may not delete copies of data that have been de-identified and are no longer linked to users or their accounts. If Amazon has used data to improve their services, they may continue to retain and use the systems trained on that data after the data has been deleted from their data stores. These limitations significantly undermine the effectiveness of Amazon's data deletion mechanisms.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n\n#### Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAmazon's recent privacy policy changes removing local processing options for Alexa voice commands represent a significant regression in privacy protections compared to industry standards. The requirement to send all voice commands to the cloud, even for users who previously opted out of cloud processing, creates substantial privacy and security risks that exceed typical industry practices.\n\n#### Comments (emerging Hazards, Exposures)\nThe decision to use digital assistants like Alexa presents a Faustian bargain for consumers. While these technologies offer great potential for improving quality of life, they also expose users to privacy risks by perpetually listening for voice data and transmitting it to third parties.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have provided guidelines for using AI, focusing on technology. ISO ethical standards that are specifically relevant to AI include ISO/IEC 27001, which addresses how organizations manage the security of their information assets. ISO-IEC 31700 sets foundational privacy principles for AI systems and helps design voice agents with privacy in mind from day one – reducing rework later and helping with regulatory alignment. Amazon should adopt these standards to better manage voice data privacy risks.\n\nVoice data stored in the cloud poses risks where hackers can gain access, or the voice technology companies themselves may misuse it. Once cybercriminals gain access to stored data on a device or cloud system, they can access recorded conversations and sensitive information. Biometric data, when stored locally, may not pose a risk to user privacy. However, abuses can occur when tech companies that offer voice recognition devices store this data in the cloud. Users have filed thousands of complaints against Google, Amazon, and Apple for improperly recording and conducting analysis on voice recordings for targeted advertising or software improvement, which sometimes violates specific states' wiretapping laws. The voice data recorded reportedly involved working with these big corporations to analyze the voice snippets. Some of these voice recordings also violated the EU's GDPR. Since then, Google suspended the transcriptions of recordings in Europe, and Apple apologized for allowing contractors to listen to voice recordings from Siri. Amazon removed its arbitration clause to allow users to sue the company for allowing its Alexa/Echo voice assistant to collect voice recordings improperly.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n\n#### Rating (2 - Deficient)\nAmazon has a documented history of privacy violations related to Alexa, including a $25 million civil penalty paid in 2023 for indefinitely storing children's Alexa recordings in violation of child privacy laws. That same year, Amazon's Ring was fined $5.8 million after an investigation revealed employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers' private video footage. These incidents indicate deficiencies in Amazon's approach to investigating and addressing privacy violations.\n\n#### Comments (claims History, Corrective Actions, Loss Trends)\nThe FTC has alleged that Amazon held onto children's voice and geolocation data indefinitely, illegally used it to improve its algorithm, and kept transcripts of their interactions with Alexa despite parents' requests to delete them. These practices would violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In addition to the $25 million civil penalty, Amazon is now prohibited from using data that has been requested to be deleted, must remove children's inactive Alexa accounts, and is required to notify its customers about the FTC's actions against the company. After the FTC intervened, Amazon added a setting to automatically delete data after three or 18 months, but still kept the indefinite setting as the default.\n\nAmazon has stated that it disagrees with the FTC's findings and does not believe it violated any laws. The company claims, \"We take our responsibilities to our customers and their families very seriously. We have consistently taken steps to protect customer privacy by providing clear privacy disclosures and customer controls, conducting ongoing audits and process improvements, and maintaining strict internal controls to protect customer data.\" Amazon also states that it requires parental consent for all children's profiles, provides a Children's Privacy Disclosure elaborating on how it uses children's data, allows child recordings and transcripts to be deleted in the Alexa app, and erases child profiles that have been inactive for at least 18 months.\n\nHowever, the FTC claims that when these issues were brought to Amazon's attention, it did not take action to remedy them. This suggests a reactive rather than proactive approach to privacy issues, which increases the risk of future violations.\n\n## Disclaimer\nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only.

Deeply integrated across operating systems, these features help users seamlessly communicate across languages with Live Translation; use visual intelligence to learn more about the onscreen content across their apps; and express themselves with enhancements to Genmoji and Image Playground. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/\n\nApple Intelligence can help users rewrite or proofread their emails or notes, summarize their missed messages, create custom memories in Photos, generate images, and more. Apple Intelligence is designed to deliver personal intelligence without Apple collecting personal data. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/intelligence-engine/\n\nDesigned to protect users' privacy at every step, many Apple Intelligence models run entirely on device. For more complex requests, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence so a user's data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/\n\n## Loss Analysis\nIn the new, real-time AI age, AI cybersecurity must address several risks, such as: Privacy concerns: Continuous data collection and analysis can lead to unauthorized access or misuse of personal information. For instance, AI-powered virtual assistants that capture frequent screenshots to personalize user experiences have raised significant privacy issues. Security vulnerabilities: Real-time AI systems can be susceptible to cyberattacks, especially if they process sensitive data without robust security measures. The rapid evolution of AI introduces new vulnerabilities, necessitating strong data protection mechanisms. https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/apple-intelligence-raises-stakes-in-privacy-and-security\n\nFor the first time in five years, global data breach costs have declined. IBM's newly released 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that average global costs dropped to USD 4.44 million—down from USD 4.88 million, or 9%, in the year prior. https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/2025-cost-of-a-data-breach-navigating-ai\n\nA staggering 97% of breached organizations that experienced an AI-related security incident say they lacked proper AI access controls, according to findings from the Cost of a Data Breach Report. Additionally, among the 600 organizations researched by the independent Ponemon Institute, 63% revealed they have no AI governance policies in place to manage AI or prevent workers from using shadow AI. https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/2025-cost-of-a-data-breach-navigating-ai\n\n## Service Planning\n\n### Immediate (0-30 days)\n- Conduct thorough compliance checks to ensure that AI-driven features comply with PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, or CCPA, especially regarding sensitive data handling. Test whether financial/health data, such as user account details or transaction histories, and medical data is processed per regulatory requirements. https://www.corellium.com/blog/apple-intelligence-data-privacy\n- Conduct security and ethical training for AI developers and users. https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/data-and-ai/ai-security-risks/\n\n### 90 Days\n- Developers should focus on offering users transparency about how Apple Intelligence interacts with their data and should provide easily accessible privacy settings. For example, users should have the option to opt out of Apple Intelligence features that process financial or sensitive communications to ensure data protection. https://www.corellium.com/blog/apple-intelligence-data-privacy\n- Implement audit-ready consent records that include timestamps, user identifiers, consent versions, specific permissions granted or denied, and geographical context. These records support regulatory investigations and demonstrate ongoing compliance efforts to supervisory authorities. https://secureprivacy.ai/blog/mobile-app-consent-ios-2025\n\n### 6-12 Months\n- To address issues in existing cyber insurance policies, consideration should be given to the development of new coverages that cater specifically to AI-related cyber events. These may include policies that offer higher limits and tailored coverage for AI-powered phishing attacks, including costs associated with advanced threat detection, response and employee training. Insurers should provide specialized endorsements or standalone policies that cover liabilities unique to AI-driven systems, such as software malfunctions, algorithmic biases and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. https://www.wtwco.com/en-us/insights/2025/03/emerging-ai-exposures-and-the-role-of-cyber-and-e-and-o-insurance\n- Undertake Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for major products and services and integrate PIAs as new products and services are developed. Reviews should include assessments of whether there is decision making relying upon algorithmic systems and the impact that such decision making has on individuals and their rights. Risk levels should be assigned to all data uses with re-review periods ranging from one to two years depending on the identified risk. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/governance/\n\n## PCO Survey Sections\n\n### Description Of Products Exposures\n\n#### End Product And Intended Use\nApple Intelligence features elevate the user experience across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Deeply integrated across operating systems, these features help users seamlessly communicate across languages with Live Translation; use visual intelligence to learn more about the onscreen content across their apps; and express themselves with enhancements to Genmoji and Image Playground. Additionally, Shortcuts can now tap into Apple Intelligence models directly to accelerate workflows, and developers are starting to take advantage of the on-device foundational model at the core of Apple Intelligence to build intelligent, privacy-protected features into their apps. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/\n\n#### Key Customers\nUsers with an Apple Intelligence-enabled device can start experiencing new features today with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/\n\n#### Stream Of Commerce\nApple Intelligence is available in beta with support for these languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, and Korean. Some features may not be available in all regions or languages. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/\n\n#### Process Flow\nWhen possible, Apple Intelligence models run entirely on device so that a task can be completed without data leaving the device. For example, when Apple Intelligence provides users with preview summaries of their emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models. There are times, however, when Apple Intelligence needs to leverage a model that requires more computational power than the device can provide on its own. For these tasks, Apple Intelligence sends the request to Private Cloud Compute. Private Cloud Compute is a server-based intelligence system designed to handle more complex requests while protecting privacy. For example, when a user uses Writing Tools to proofread or edit an email, their device may send the email to Private Cloud Compute for a server-based model to do the proofreading or editing. When a user initiates an Apple Intelligence task, a model running on their device analyzes whether the task can be completed on device. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/intelligence-engine/\n\n#### Sales Distribution\nThese features are available now as a free software update with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26.

The cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, so it is aware of your personal information without collecting your personal information. https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/apple-intelligence-and-privacy-iphe3f499e0e/ios\n\n### Loss Potential\n\n#### Frequency\nIs the risk materializing in the real world? The answer is yes. The report reveals that 13% of surveyed organizations have experienced an attack that impacted their AI models or applications. That percentage is small, for now. We are likely to see many more in the coming 12 months, unless security leaders and their business counterparts recognize the risk and pivot to focus more intently on AI security. https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/2025-cost-of-a-data-breach-navigating-ai\n\n#### Severity\nIn today's digital landscape, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various industries has introduced significant security risks and compliance challenges, with 73% of enterprises experiencing at least one AI-related security incident in the past 12 months, according to Gartner's 2024 AI Security Survey, resulting in an average cost of $4.8 million per breach. The financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors are particularly vulnerable to AI-related attacks, with financial services firms facing the highest regulatory penalties, averaging $35.2 million per AI compliance failure. https://superagi.com/from-data-breaches-to-compliance-how-ai-can-optimize-gtm-security-in-2025/\n\n#### Scenarios\nFor this reason, the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) ranked prompt injection as the number one security AI risk in 2025. Consider this: A hospital creates a customer service chatbot using AI. Patients send queries and the system accesses internal databases to answer them. But a threat actor sends a prompt injection that tricks the system into sharing sensitive patient health information. The hospital now has a security failure that likely requires a digital forensics investigation, legal counsel, and patient notification. Without clear policy language, traditional cyber coverage may fall short if an AI model resulted in a security failure or privacy breach. And as a result of the above prompt injection, businesses would ideally also want to have both first-party and third-party coverage that addresses direct financial losses for both investigation costs and liability as a result of the breach. https://www.coalitioninc.com/blog/cyber-insurance/ai-advancements-are-reshaping-cyber-insurance-coverage\n\n#### Comments\nApple's long-standing reputation for prioritizing privacy gives it a competitive edge. Yet, even with robust safeguards, no system is infallible. Compromised AI features — especially those tied to messaging and notifications — could become a goldmine for social engineering schemes, threatening the very trust that Apple has built its brand upon. https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/apple-intelligence-raises-stakes-in-privacy-and-security\n\n### Design & Engineering\n\n#### Rating (3 - Strong)\nWhen a user makes a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on device. If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, which will send only the data that is relevant to the task to be processed on Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple, and is only used to fulfill the user's requests. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-extends-its-privacy-leadership-with-new-updates-across-its-platforms/\n\n#### Comments (labels, Warnings, IFUs, Legal Review)\nThe Apple silicon servers that form the foundation of Private Cloud Compute provide unprecedented cloud security. This starts with the Secure Enclave, which protects critical encryption keys on the server just as it does on a user's iPhone, while Secure Boot ensures the OS running on the server is signed and verified, just like in iOS. Trusted Execution Monitor makes sure only signed and verified code runs, and attestation enables a user's device to securely verify the identity and configuration of a Private Cloud Compute cluster before sending a request. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-extends-its-privacy-leadership-with-new-updates-across-its-platforms/\n\nThis starts with the Secure Enclave, which protects critical encryption keys on the server just as it does on a user's iPhone, while Secure Boot ensures the OS running on the server is signed and verified, just like in iOS.

There is additional tailored privacy and security training provided on a per-team basis to employees who handle or have access to high volumes of data, sensitive personal data, or as additionally required by local law. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/governance/\n\n#### Comments (regulatory Standards, Inspections, Compliance History)\nThe privacy policy of Apple and the new AI tools are to be compliant with such strict data protection legislation as GDPR and CCPA. The policy of the company describes the process of its collection, use, and storage of personal data, and it contains the provisions that make users have the right to access, correct, and delete their information. The emergence of AI-driven tools which demand an access to personal information has direct links with such laws. In the event of the new AI features, Apple should make sure that it will still receive transparent, explicit permission of users to process any of their data, especially when dealing with third-party services such as ChatGPT. The requirement of GDPR and CCPA is addressed directly by the measures of the company, according to which data sharing with the third-party AI models should be an explicit opt-in option of users. https://legalmaestros.com/current-legal-update/iphone-17s-ai-tools-privacy-policy-under-fire-for-gdpr-ccpa-violations/\n\nAccountability requires organizations to take responsibility for data handling and demonstrate that their practices, systems, policies, and training are achieving Apple's compliance objectives. With ongoing oversight and assurance reviews, Apple has received privacy accountability certifications for its global privacy program since 2014 that adhere to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework. In APEC countries where Apple operates, the international transfer of personal data collected abides by the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System and the Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System. Apple's global privacy policy and practices are reviewed by an approved independent third-party Accountability Agent who monitors and enforces compliance with APEC CBPR and PRP program requirements.

Google is also updating how it handles uploaded content, including files and photos, with the \"Gemini Apps Activity\" setting being renamed to \"Keep Activity.\"\n\n### PCO Operations Considered\n\n#### Conclusion Rating (2)\nGoogle Gemini presents Medium to significant liability concerns due to its data retention practices, human review processes, and recently discovered security vulnerabilities.\n\n#### Comments\nHuman reviewers (including trained reviewers from service providers) review some of the collected data to improve Google services. Google explicitly warns users not to enter confidential information that they wouldn't want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve services, including machine-learning technologies.\n\nGoogle's business privacy agreements dictate that data may be logged and stored as long as necessary for security, monitoring, QA, abuse prevention, and analytics. Even if users remove their content, residual logs can persist for as long as Google wants.\n\n### Loss Potential\n\n#### Frequency\nHigh - Given the volume of users and data processed, privacy incidents are likely to occur regularly.\n\n#### Severity\nMedium to High - Data breaches can be extremely costly, as seen in the case of Target, where the total cost, including lawsuits and other expenses, was $252 million. While Google has more robust security measures, the potential impact of a significant data breach involving sensitive personal information could be substantial.\n\n#### Scenarios\n1. **Prompt Injection Attack**: Google Gemini for Workspace can be abused to generate email summaries that appear legitimate but contain malicious instructions or warnings. Attackers can redirect victims to phishing sites without attachments or direct links.\n\n2. **Data Retention Breach**: Gemini retains personal data for up to three years, creating a significant repository of potentially sensitive information that could be compromised. A breach exposing this data could lead to significant privacy violations and regulatory penalties.\n\n3. **Unauthorized Data Indexing**: Despite Google's safeguards, some Gemini conversation pages have been indexed by search engines, potentially exposing private conversations.\n\n#### Comments\nGoogle's Gemini API Terms explicitly state users should not upload sensitive personal information, such as health records, financial numbers, government IDs, or biometric information unless legally necessary and appropriately secured. Even if deleted from the user's side, logs and internal analysis copies may persist within Google's systems.\n\n### Design & Engineering\n\n#### Rating (3)\nGoogle has implemented strong design elements for privacy and security, but some vulnerabilities remain.\n\n#### Comments\nTo protect user privacy, Gemini activity is set by default to auto-delete after 18 months, but users have control to adjust this setting. Users can adjust this setting to auto-delete sooner, later, or turn off Gemini Apps Activity entirely.\n\nGoogle has introduced a \"Temporary Chat\" feature that allows conversations that won't be saved or used for personalization. Users have more control over their data with updated settings.\n\nHowever, design vulnerabilities exist, such as the prompt injection vulnerability that allows attackers to create fake Google security alerts that appear legitimate but include malicious phone numbers or phishing links.\n\n### Production & Manufacturing\n\n#### Rating (3)\nGoogle's infrastructure for Gemini is robust, with strong security controls but some areas for improvement.\n\n#### Comments\nGoogle was one of the first in the industry to publish an AI/ML privacy commitment, outlining their belief that customers should have the highest level of security and control over their data stored in the cloud. This commitment extends to Google Cloud generative AI products.\n\nAll data that Gemini processes is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies can prevent sensitive data from being leaked or accessed by unauthorized users. All user activity and changes to data are logged and can be reviewed.\n\nRole-based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to restrict who can access and use Gemini.\n\n### Regulatory Management\n\n#### Rating (2)\nSignificant concerns exist regarding compliance with global privacy regulations.\n\n#### Comments\nGoogle has stated they believe that AI is too important not to regulate and is committed to compliance with all applicable laws. Google is signing the European Union's General Purpose AI Code of Practice.\n\nGemini is reportedly compliant with several specific regulations, including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).\n\nHowever, When asked if Gemini is GDPR-compliant, experts indicate it is not fully compliant. Aspects such as data processing, potential human review, and third-party data sharing raise GDPR compliance concerns.\n\nTo address European data privacy requirements, Gemini now supports regional data residency guarantees for organizations operating under GDPR. Enterprise and select Team workspaces can configure storage within dedicated EU regions — specifically europe-west12 and de-central1. However, free and Pro consumer tiers cannot enable data residency locking; only Workspace-based plans support regional scoping.\n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall\n\n#### Rating (2)\nGoogle has monitoring systems in place, but significant concerns exist regarding data retention and human review.\n\n#### Comments\nA subset of Gemini conversations are reviewed by human reviewers (including Google's trained service providers) to help improve Google services. Reviewers assess if Gemini Apps' responses were low-quality, inaccurate, or harmful.\n\nGoogle retains user data reviewed and annotated by human reviewers for up to three years to improve AI models. This information, along with feedback and related metadata such as language, device type, or location, is kept separately and is not connected to the user's Google Account.\n\nThis raises concerns about transparency and user control. Even if users delete their Gemini activity, conversations reviewed by human reviewers are retained for up to three years.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n\n#### Rating (2)\nSignificant industry-specific exposures exist with some controls in place.\n\n#### Comments\nA prompt-injection vulnerability creates realistic-looking Google Security alerts that could be used in vishing and phishing attacks across various Google products. This represents a significant industry exposure for AI assistants.\n\nSecurity researchers have discovered that Google Gemini for Workspace is prone to indirect prompt injection attacks. Indirect injections rely on delivering the prompt injection through channels such as documents, emails, and other assets the LLM has access to, with the purpose of taking over the chatbot or language model.\n\nGoogle has implemented some controls, including integrating Mandiant's security offerings into the platform. The integration added automated security agents that use GenAI to detect, stop, and remediate cybersecurity attacks as quickly as possible and to analyze code to find security problems.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n\n#### Rating (3)\nGoogle has strong incident response capabilities but some areas for improvement.\n\n#### Comments\nIn response to security incidents, Google has issued official statements aimed at addressing and clarifying matters. Google has also provided users with enhanced control over data retention to alleviate concerns regarding the Google Gemini AI retention mechanism.\n\nGoogle has posted to its blog outlining specific defenses that it's deploying for prompt injection-style attacks and is in \"mid-deployment on several of these updated defenses.\" Google has stated that \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us, and we've deployed numerous strong defenses to keep users safe, including safeguards to prevent harmful or misleading responses.\"\n\n## Disclaimer\nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only.
