Traceability exists via account logs, but deletion gaps remain for reviewer copies.  \n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls  \n- Rating (1-4): 2  \n- Comments  \n  Emerging ADMT regulations will increase exposure; limited public adoption of ISO privacy frameworks; competitor incidents show escalating scrutiny.  \n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis  \n- Rating (1-4): 2  \n- Comments  \n  Prior contractor leak shows root-cause analysis led to policy updates, but recurrent human-review model indicates residual risk.
