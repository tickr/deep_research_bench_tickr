Zero-click exploit leaks executive emails (EchoLeak).  \n  2. Mis-labelled confidential file summarised and exposed to unauthorised user despite policy misconfiguration.  \n  3. Bing query outside EU Data Boundary results in cross-border transfer claim.  \n- Comments: Severity mitigated by swift patching practices but residual reputational harm remains.  \n\n### Design & Engineering  \n- Rating (1-4): 3 – Adequate  \n- Comments: “Commercial data protection” design avoids training on customer data [10]; secure-by-design posture. However, testing did not pre-empt EchoLeak; independent red-team not yet institutionalised. Labels & Warnings: Microsoft disclaims output accuracy and instructs guardrail use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy.  \n\n### Production & Manufacturing  \n- Rating (1-4): 3 – Adequate  \n- Comments: Server-side patch deployment within four months of disclosure shows responsive release management [3] Contracts include copyright indemnity but exclude privacy fines [6]:contentItem:6F5K-4CB3-SJ2N-64J8-00000-00#34.  \n\n### Regulatory Management  \n- Rating (1-4): 2 – Basic  \n- Comments: GDPR compliance asserted; EU Data Boundary completed, yet Bing search queries from Copilot currently non-compliant https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/privacy-and-protections. No evidence of ISO 27001/27701 certification specific to Copilot – would strengthen posture.  \n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall  \n- Rating (1-4): 3 – Adequate  \n- Comments: Vulnerability disclosure program resulted in EchoLeak patch; audit & eDiscovery logging available for web queries https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/manage-public-web-access. CAPA processes appear effective but need shorter remediation SLAs for zero-days.  \n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls  \n- Rating (1-4): 2 – Basic  \n- Comments: Independent AI agents in Copilot Studio introduce new exposure [19]; emerging regulatory focus on AI safety not fully addressed.  \n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis  \n- Rating (1-4): 3 – Adequate  \n- Comments: No confirmed real-world data-leak claims; Microsoft acted swiftly on researcher-reported vulnerability [3] Loss trends show rising CISO concern [14]  \n\n## Disclaimer  \nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only."}
