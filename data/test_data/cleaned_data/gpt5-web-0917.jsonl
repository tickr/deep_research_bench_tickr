Default activity retention is 18 months, with an auto-delete option (3–36 months or off) (https://safety.google/intl/en_us/products/gemini/). Chats flagged for quality/safety are human-reviewed and retained up to three years, even if users delete their history (https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961). When acting as Android assistant, the app accesses call logs, contacts, installed apps, and screen content (https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961). Temporary Chat mode keeps data ≤72 hours and excludes it from training (https://blog.google/products/gemini/temporary-chats-privacy-controls/).  \n\n## Loss Analysis  \n• 2023: $93 M California AG settlement over deceptive location-privacy disclosures, indicating willingness of regulators to pursue large fines (https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-93-million-settlement-regarding-google%E2%80%99s).  \n• EU launch delay for Bard (pre-Gemini) due to incomplete DPIA under GDPR (https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761893/google-ai-chatbot-bard-eu-launch-delayed-privacy).  \n• Media criticism of three-year human-review retention increased churn risk (https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24072389/google-gemini-will-hang-onto-your-chats-for-up-to-three-years).  \nNo known third-party claims specific to Gemini yet; exposure trending upward with widening rollout.  \n\n## Service Planning  \nImmediate (0-30 days)  \n• Disable auto-reversion bug on “Keep Activity” toggle.  \n• Publish clarifying FAQ on human-review retention and opt-out procedures.  \n\n90 Days  \n• Complete DPIA covering consumer Gemini EU/UK.  \n• Map cross-app data flows; integrate GPC signal handling.  \n• Reduce three-year reviewer retention to 12 months; document legal basis.  \n\n6–12 Months  \n• Seek ISO 42001 certification for consumer Gemini.  \n• Implement automated deletion triggers tied to account deletion for reviewer datasets.  \n• Conduct tabletop breach exercises incorporating connected-app scenarios.  \n\n## PCO Survey Sections  \n\n### Description Of Products Exposures  \n- End Product And Intended Use: AI chatbot responding to text, voice, and image prompts for consumer productivity and information.  \n- Key Customers: Global English-speaking consumer base; high concentration in US/EU.  \n- Stream Of Commerce: Distribution through Google Play & iOS App Store; backend processing in Google Cloud regions.  \n- Process Flow: User prompt → collection of contextual device data → model inference → storage in Gemini Apps Activity DB → periodic sampling for model training → optional human review dataset (retained 3 yrs).  \n- Sales Distribution: Freemium; revenue indirect via ecosystem stickiness (no ads currently) (https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961).  \n- Additional Details: Connected calling/messaging apps allowed even when Keep Activity off unless manually disabled (https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961).  \n\n### PCO Operations Considered  \n- Conclusion Rating (1-4): 2 (Needs Improvement)  \n- Comments: Core privacy controls exist but several default-on settings, extended retention, and UX flaws elevate breach and compliance risk.  \n\n### Loss Potential  \n- Frequency: Medium (large user base, continuous data ingestion).  \n- Severity: High (regulatory fines up to 4 % global revenue under GDPR, class-action exposure under CCPA).  \n- Scenarios:  \n  1. Breach of human-review dataset containing sensitive chats retained 3 yrs.  \n  2. Failure to honour GPC opt-out leading to statutory damages.  \n  3. Mis-scoped permissions leak cross-app data (contacts, SMS).  \n- Comments: Historic enforcement against related Google services illustrates severity trend.  \n\n### Design & Engineering  \n- Rating (1-4): 3  \n- Comments: Privacy controls (Temporary Chat, Personal Context toggle) meet privacy-by-design baseline, yet default settings favour extended retention; label advises users not to share confidential data (https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961).  \n\n### Production & Manufacturing  \n- Rating (1-4): 3  \n- Comments: Uses Google Cloud infra with encryption in transit (https://play.google.com/store/apps/datasafety?gl=US&hl=en_US&id=com.google.android.apps.bard).

AI outputs personal data (phone numbers, addresses) → DPA investigation & class action.  \n  2. Unlawful cross-border data transfer for model fine-tuning → suspension of service in EU.  \n  3. Confidential computing enclave breach → mass disclosure of message summaries.  \n- Comments: Each scenario can trigger multi-jurisdictional penalties and user attrition.  \n\n### Design & Engineering  \n- Rating (1-4): 2  \n- Comments: Positive controls include confidential-computing for summaries and “/reset-ai” deletion https://engineering.fb.com/2025/04/29/security/whatsapp-private-processing-ai-tools/; however, lack of E2EE for AI chats and human review of prompts create residual exposure.
