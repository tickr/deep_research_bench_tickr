No evidence of comprehensive vendor risk management for AI model training data.\n\n### Regulatory Management\n**Rating: 4 (Very Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nMultiple regulatory violations documented. Failed to comply with GDPR Article 46(1) on international transfers. Transparency requirements repeatedly violated - Dutch DPA fine for failing to provide privacy information in local language. No evidence of proactive regulatory engagement. Compliance appears reactive to enforcement actions rather than preventive.\n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall\n**Rating: 3 (Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nLimited evidence of systematic monitoring for privacy violations. Incident response demonstrated in journalist surveillance case but indicates control failures. No clear data deletion verification process. CAPA processes not transparent. User complaint mechanisms exist but effectiveness unclear.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n**Rating: 3 (Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nEmerging AI regulations in EU and potential federal privacy legislation in US create evolving compliance landscape. Biometric data collection creates unique exposure - only three US states have protective laws. Geopolitical tensions with China amplify regulatory scrutiny. Competitive platforms (Meta, Google) face similar issues but TikTok receives disproportionate attention due to Chinese ownership.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n**Rating: 3 (Deficient)**\n\n**Comments:**\nPattern of repeated violations suggests inadequate root cause analysis. €530M fine in 2025 for issues dating to 2021 indicates slow remediation. Limited transparency on corrective actions. No evidence of enterprise risk management framework addressing systemic privacy risks. Claims history shows escalating penalties rather than improvement.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only.

Legal review of all AI-generated medical content is essential but not consistently enforced across implementations.\n\n### Production & Manufacturing\n\n**Rating**: 2 (Medium)\n\n**Comments**: Google Cloud infrastructure provides enterprise-grade security with encryption at rest and in transit. Supplier risk exists through third-party integrators like Augmedix. Risk transfer mechanisms via BAAs are available but not universally implemented. Insurance coverage for AI-specific liabilities remains unclear in standard cyber policies. Contract terms must explicitly address AI hallucination liability, data retention, and model update responsibilities.\n\n### Regulatory Management\n\n**Rating**: 2 (Medium)\n\n**Comments**: Google maintains HIPAA compliance certifications for cloud infrastructure. FDA has not yet cleared Med-PaLM as a medical device, operating in regulatory gray area. New FDA guidance on AI-enabled devices creates compliance uncertainty. State-level AI healthcare regulations emerging rapidly. No reported FDA warning letters or enforcement actions to date, but regulatory landscape evolving quickly.\n\n### Post-Market Surveillance & Recall\n\n**Rating**: 3 (Medium-High Risk)\n\n**Comments**: Limited evidence of comprehensive post-market surveillance for AI hallucinations. No established recall protocols for erroneous AI outputs. CAPA processes underdeveloped for machine learning model errors. Traceability challenging due to continuous model updates and lack of version control transparency. Google promises \"minimal risk of AI hallucinations\" for Vertex AI Search, but independent verification lacking. Need for systematic adverse event reporting system specific to AI-generated medical advice.\n\n### Industry Exposures & Controls\n\n**Rating**: 3 (Medium-High Risk)\n\n**Comments**: Emerging exposure from AI hallucination liability, as demonstrated by Texas AG settlement with Pieces Technologies. Whisper AI harmful hallucinations and WHO S.A.R.A.H. chatbot inaccuracies highlight industry-wide challenges. Controls include human-in-the-loop requirements and transparency measures, but implementation inconsistent. Competitive pressure to deploy AI quickly may compromise safety protocols. Industry lacks standardized testing for medical AI hallucination rates.\n\n### Accident Investigations & Loss Analysis\n\n**Rating**: 3 (Medium-High Risk)\n\n**Comments**: Limited claims history due to technology novelty, but early malpractice cases emerging. Courts struggling to allocate liability between AI vendors, healthcare systems, and physicians. No evidence of systematic root cause analysis for AI errors. Corrective actions focus on model retraining rather than systemic risk reduction. Loss trends indicate increasing frequency of AI-related incidents but severity remains uncertain.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nRisk Control evaluations, reports, and recommendations are for underwriting support only.
